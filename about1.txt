 Welcome to my webpage. Hope you are in good health and spirit.
    
     Looks like you've come here to know something more about me . Well , I guess that since you've reached "About" section so till
now you must be knowing my name. If not ,let me introduce myself.... Hi my name is Aditya Thakur. I was born and brought up in 
Himachal Pradesh , India . I had my schooling and graduation from my homestate itself . Thereafter,spent 2 years doing PG under great 
prof's. and inspiring friends at KGP . Right now I am working in SAANKHYA LABS as a Baseband Algorithm Development Engineer . Here I've 
got oppurtunities to explore the field of Wireless communication engineering in much more depth. 
      
      Apart from this I love to sing songs . Photography is also one of my hobbies. You can visit my instagram page to view some of
my clicks. During my college days I had some amazing trip with my friends. We had trips to 'Manali' , 'Sangla' , 'Dalhousie' etc.
The memories built during these trips will always stay with me. I also love trekking . This is because , it brings me much closer to the
nature. I have been to Churdhar , Chandranahan , Karol and Sangla by trekking . I just can't explain the beauty that one gets to see when
he's on these treks. These treks are truly mesmerizing. 
      
       So, that was a brief about me .Hope you enjoyed!
